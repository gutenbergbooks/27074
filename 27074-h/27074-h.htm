to us, and have been published for the last thirty years with his
comedies. These are, 'La Jalousie du Barbouill&eacute;,' and 'Le M&eacute;decin
Volant.' Moli&egrave;re has made use of the former in the third act of the
comedy called 'George Dandin.'</p>

<h2>THE JEALOUSY OF LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE I.&mdash;&mdash;LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. Everybody must acknowledge that I am the most unfortunate of men!
I have a wife who plagues me to death; and who, instead of bringing me
comfort and doing things as I like them to be done, makes me swear at
her twenty times a day. Instead of keeping at home, she likes gadding
about, eating good dinners, and passing her time with people of I
don't know what description. Ah! poor Barbouill&eacute;, how much you are to
be pitied! But she must be punished. Suppose you killed her?&#8230; It
would do no good, for you would be hung afterwards. If you were to
have her sent to prison?&#8230; The minx would find means of coming out.
What the deuce are you to do?&mdash;But here is the doctor coming out this
way; suppose I ask his advice on my difficulties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;&mdash;DOCTOR, LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
I was going to fetch you, to beg for your opinion on a question
of great importance to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
You must be very ill-bred, very loutish, and very badly taught,
my friend, to speak to me in that fashion, without first taking off
your hat, without observing <i>rationem loci, temporis et person&aelig;</i>.
What! you begin by an abrupt speech, instead of saying <i>Salve</i>, vel
<i>salvus sis, doctor doctorum eruditissime</i>. What do you take me for,
eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Really, doctor, I am very sorry; the fact is that I am almost
beside myself, and did not think of what I was doing; but I know you
are a gallant man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Do you know what <i>gallant man</i> comes from?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
It matters little to me whether it comes from Villejuif or
Aubervilliers.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Know that the word <i>gallant man</i> comes from <i>elegant</i>. By taking
the <i>g</i> and the <i>a</i> of the last syllable, that makes <i>ga</i>; then by
taking the two <i>ll</i>'s, adding <i>a</i> and the two last letters <i>nt</i>, that
makes <i>gallant</i>; then by adding <i>man</i> you have <i>gallant man</i>. But to
come back to what I said; What do you take me for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
I take you for a doctor. But let us speak a little of what I have
to propose to you. You must know that &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Let me tell you first that I am not only a doctor, but that I am
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten times
doctor. Firstly, number one is the base, the foundation, and the first
of all numbers; so am I the first of all doctors, the most learned of
the learned. Secondly, there are two faculties essential for a perfect
knowledge of things: the sense and the understanding; I am all sense,
all understanding: ergo, I am twice doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. Agreed. What I want &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Thirdly, according to Aristotle, the number three is that of
perfection; I am perfect; and every thing I do is perfect: ergo, I am
three times doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. Very well then, doctor&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Fourthly, philosophy is divided into four parts, logic, morals,
physics, and metaphysics; I possess all four, and know them perfectly:
ergo, I am four times doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Deuce take it, I don't doubt it. Listen to me then.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Fifthly, there are five universals: the genus, the species, the
differentia, the property, and the accident, without knowing which it
is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions; I make great
use of them, and know how important they are; ergo, I am five times
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. I must have patience.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Sixthly, number six is the number of work; I work incessantly for
my own glory; ergo, I am six times doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Well, well, speak as long as you like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Seventhly, the number seven is the number of bliss; I possess a
perfect knowledge of all that can produce happiness, and by my talents
am happy myself. I am therefore forced to say of myself: <i>O ter
quaterque beatum!</i> Eighthly, the number eight is the number of
justice, on account of the equality which is found in it; the justice
and prudence with which I measure and weigh all my actions make me
eight times doctor. Ninthly, there are nine Muses, and I am equally
the favourite of them all. Tenthly, one cannot pass number ten without
repeating all the other numbers, and it is the universal number.
Similarly, when people have found me, they have found the universal
doctor; and I am in myself all the other doctors together. Thus, with
the help of these plausible, true, demonstrative, and convincing
reasons, you see that I am one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten times doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
What the deuce does he mean by all this? I thought I had found a
clever man who would give me good advice, and I find a chimney-sweep,
who, instead of speaking to me, plays at mora.<a href="#flb1">
<span class="small"><sup>1</sup></span></a> One, two, three,
four&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;ha! ha! Come, come, that's not it; you must listen to
me, and remember that I am not a man to make you lose your time; I
shall make it worth your while, and if you can satisfy me in what I
want of you, I will give you what you wish&mdash;money, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>. Ha! money?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Yes, money; and whatever you may ask besides.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
(<i>sharply, tucking up his gown behind him</i>). Then you take me for
a man who would do anything for money, for a man fond of money, for a
mercenary soul? Know, my friend, that if you were to give me a purse
full of gold, and that this purse were in a rich box, this box in a
precious case, this case in a superb chest, this chest in a rare
museum, this museum in a magnificent apartment, this apartment in a
gorgeous castle, this castle in a wonderful citadel, this citadel in a
celebrated town, this town in a fertile island, this island in an
opulent province, this province in a flourishing monarchy, this
monarchy in the whole world;<a href="#flb2"><span class="small"><sup>2</sup></span></a>
that if you gave me the world in which
this flourishing monarchy would be, in which this opulent province
would be, in which this fertile island would be, in which this
celebrated town would be, in which this wonderful citadel would be, in
which this gorgeous castle would be, in which this pleasant apartment
would be, in which this rare museum would be, in which this wonderful
chest would be, in which this precious case would be, in which this
rich box would be, in which the purse full of gold would be, I should
care no more for it than this (<i>snaps his fingers and exit</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Well. I made a mistake. Seeing him dressed as a doctor, I felt
that of necessity I must speak of money to him; but since he does not
want any, nothing can be more easy than to satisfy him. I'll run after
him. (<i>Runs out.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;&mdash;ANG&Eacute;LIQUE, VAL&Egrave;RE, CATHAU.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
I assure you, sir, that you will oblige me very much by coming to
see me sometimes: my husband is so ugly, so ill-behaved, and such a
drunkard, that it is perfect martyrdom for me to be with him, and I
ask you what pleasure one can have with such a clown as he is?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Val</span>.
You do me too much honour. I promise you I shall do my utmost to
amuse you, and since you are kind enough to say that my company is not
unpleasant, my care and attentions shall prove to you what pleasure
this good news gives me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cat</span>.
Ay! quick, talk of something else; here's our old bugbear coming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.&mdash;&mdash;LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;, VAL&Egrave;RE, ANG&Eacute;LIQUE, CATHAU.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Val</span>.
Mademoiselle,<a href="#flb3"><span class="small"><sup>3</sup></span></a>
I am very sorry to bring you such bad news, but,
you would have heard it from some one else, and since your brother is
ill&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Ah! say no more, sir, I am your servant, and thank you very much
for the trouble you have taken.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Val&egrave;re</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Well! what need is there of my having a certificate of my
cuckledom from the notary? So! so! you trollop! I find you with a man
in spite of all my remonstrances, and you want to send me from Gemini
to Capricornus.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Are you going to scold me for that? This gentleman only just came
to tell me of my brother's serious illness: why should you make that a
subject of quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cat</span>.
Ah, directly I saw him, I wondered if we should be long in peace.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
You spoil one another, you women; you, Cathau, you corrupt my
wife; she is not half as good now as she was before she had you to
wait upon her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cat</span>.
Really you treat me in a nice manner.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Leave the drunkard alone; don't you see that he is so muddled
that he does not even know what he says.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE V.&mdash;&mdash;GORGIBUS, VILLEBREQUIN, ANG&Eacute;LIQUE,
CATHAU, LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
Now, there's my cursed son-in-law scolding my daughter again!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>.
We must see what is the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
What! will you always be quarrelling! Will you never have peace
at home?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
This hussy calls me drunkard.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ang&eacute;lique</span>) Here, I have a
great mind to give you a good dressing<a href="#flb4"><span class="small"><sup>4</sup></span></a>
before your relations.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
May the dev &#8230; may his money be blessed, if you have done as he
says.<a href="#flb5"><span class="small"><sup>5</sup></span></a> </p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
It is always he who begins to &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cat</span>.
Cursed be the hour when you chose that sordid wretch!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.&mdash;&mdash;GORGIBUS, VILLEBREQUIN, ANG&Eacute;LIQUE,
CATHAU, LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;, DOCTOR.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Why, what is the meaning of this? what a disorder! what a
quarrel! what a racket! what a row! what a noise! what a dispute! what
a combustion! What is the matter, gentlemen? what is the matter? what
is the matter? Come, come, is there no way of making you agree, let me
be your pacificator; suffer me to bring peace among you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
It is my son-in-law and my daughter who have had words together.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
But what can it be? Now, come, let me know the cause of their
dispute.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. Sir &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>. But in a few words &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. Yes, yes; but put on your hat.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Hat; that is bonnet. Do you know what bonnet comes from?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
It comes from <i>bonum est, it is good, a thing which is good</i>,
because it saves one from colds and coughs.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
Indeed! I did not know that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Now quick, the subject of your quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. This is what happened.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
I hope you are not a man to keep me long when I pray you not to
do so. I have some pressing business which calls me to town; still, if
I can bring peace to your family, I am willing to stop a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. I shall soon have done.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>. Be quick, then.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. It will be said in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
We must acknowledge, Mr. Gorgibus, that it is a wonderful gift to
be able to say things in a few words, and that great talkers, instead
of being heard, become often so wearisome that one cannot listen to
them; <i>virtutem primam esse puta compescere linguam.</i> Yes, the best
quality of an honest man is silence.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. You must know then &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
There are three things which Socrates used to recommend
particularly to his disciples: to be careful of one's actions, to be
sober in eating, and to say things in a few words. Begin, Mr.
Gorgibus.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. It is my wish to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
In a few words, without ceremony, without indulging in a long
speech: cut it short with an apophthegm<a href="#flb6"><span class="small"><sup>6</sup></span></a>;
quick, quick, Mr. Gorgibus, make haste, avoid prolixity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. Suffer me to speak then&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
That's enough Mr. Gorgibus, you speak too much. Somebody else
must tell me what was the cause of their quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>. You must know, sir, that &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
You are an ignoramus, an unlearned man, ignorant of all good
rules; an ass, in plain English. What! you begin a discourse without a
word of exordium! Some one else must tell me what happened; will you,
young lady, tell me the particulars of all this noise?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Do you see here my fat rascal, my wine-barrel of a husband &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Gently, if you please, speak with respect of your husband when
you are under the nose of a doctor like me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Ah! I should just think so, doctor! I care little for you or your
doctrine, and I am a doctor whenever I please.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
You, a doctor when you please. A nice doctor you make. You seem
to me to do much as you wish&#8230;. But, I say, tell me the subject of
your uproar.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. Sir, your honour &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
You begin well. "Your honour!" this word has something flattering
to the ear, something full of magniloquence; "your honour!"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. According to my will.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Quite right&#8230;. "According to my will!" the will speaks of a
wish, the wish presupposes means to come to one's ends, and the end
presupposes an object. It is well said, "according to my will!"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. I am bursting with rage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Cut out this word "bursting." It is a low, vulgar expression.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. But, doctor, listen to me for mercy's sake.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>. <i>Audi, qu&aelig;so</i>, would C&aelig;sar have
said.<a href="#flb7"><span class="small"><sup>7</sup></span></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Seize her, or don't seize her, you will listen to me or I will
break your doctoral neck! What the devil do you mean by all this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.&mdash;&mdash;VAL&Egrave;RE, LA VALL&Eacute;E.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Val</span>.
I am extremely obliged to you, sir, for the trouble you have
taken, and I promise you that in about an hour's time I shall be at
the place of rendezvous you give me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">La Val</span>.
It cannot be put off so long, in a quarter of an hour the ball
will be over, and you will miss the pleasure of meeting there the
person you love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Val</span>. Let us go together then.</p>

<p>(<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Val&egrave;re</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smallcaps">La Vall&eacute;e.</span>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.&mdash;&mdash;ANG&Eacute;LIQUE (<i>alone</i>).</h3>

<p>While my husband is absent, I will just go round to a ball given by
one of our neighbours. I shall be back before him, for he is somewhere
drinking; he will not even know that I am gone out. The wretched knave
always leaves me alone at home, as if I were his dog.
(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ang&eacute;lique</span>.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IX.&mdash;&mdash;LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h3>

<p>I knew that I should master that brute of a doctor and his stupid
doctrine. Devil take the ignorant ass! I soon brought all his science
to the ground. I must now go and see if our good wife has prepared
anything for my supper. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE X.&mdash;&mdash;ANG&Eacute;LIQUE.</h3>

<p>How unlucky! I went too late, the party was over. I arrived just as
everybody was leaving. But never mind, it shall be for another time. I
will go home as if nothing was the matter. Bless me! the door is
locked; Cathau! Cathau!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XI.&mdash;&mdash;LE BARBOUILL&Eacute; (<i>at the window</i>), ANG&Eacute;LIQUE.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
"Cathau! Cathau!" Well! what is the matter with Cathau? And where
do you come from at this time of night, and in such weather?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Where I come from? Just open the door, and I will tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Yes, you catch me! You may go and sleep where you come from; I
shall not open to a gad-about like you. What! alone at this time of
night! I don't know if it is fancy, but my forehead seems to me
already rougher by half.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Well, what do you mean by scolding me because I am alone? You
scold me if I have anybody near me; what am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Stop at home, give orders for the supper, take care of the
household, and of the children; but it is no use talking so much;
good-bye, good night, go to the devil and leave me in peace.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. You won't open to me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. No. I shall not open to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Ah! my dear little husband, I beg of you open the door; do, my
darling little heart.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Ah! crocodile! Ah! dangerous serpent! you caress me to betray me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. Open, do open.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Farewell! <i>Vade retro, Satanas!</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. What, you won't open.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
You have no pity for the wife who loves you so much?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
No, I am inflexible. You have offended me, I am revengeful like
the very devil! that is to say plainly that I am inexorable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Do you know that if you push me too far, and put me in a passion,
I may do something which will make you repent your unkindness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
And what will you do, dear little vixen?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
I declare that if you do not open to me, I will kill myself
before the door; my parents will no doubt come here before going to
bed, to see if we are all right together, and they will find me dead,
and you will be hanged.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Ha! ha! ha! ha! the silly creature! Tell me who would lose the
most? Nonsense, you are not so foolish as to play such a trick.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
You don't believe me. See, here is my knife all ready, if you do
not open at once I will pierce myself to the heart with it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Take care, it is very sharp.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. You won't open to me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
I have told you twenty times that I shall not open; kill
yourself, die, go to the devil, I care not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. (<i>pretending to stab herself</i>).
Farewell then&#8230;. Ay! I am dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Can she be stupid enough to do such a thing? I must go down with
the light and see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. (<i>aside</i>).
I will pay you back. If I can only slip into the house
while you are looking for me, it shall be my turn. (<i>She runs past</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Barbouill&eacute;</span>,
<i>and manages to get into the house without his knowledge.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Well! I knew she was not so stupid as all that! She is dead, and
yet she runs like Pacolet's horse.<a href="#flb8"><span class="small"><sup>8</sup></span></a>
To say the truth, she really
frightened me, she did right to run away, for if I had found her alive
after she had given me such a fright, my boot would have taught her
not to play the fool. I must go to bed now. Hallo! the wind must have
shut the door to, I fear. Hi! Cathau, Cathau, open the door.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>. (<i>at the window</i>).
"Cathau, Cathau! well what is the matter with
Cathau?" and where do you come from, you drunkard? Well, well, my
parents will soon be here, and will hear all about you. You wine-tap,
you infamous wretch, you do not stir from the public-house; but leave
a poor wife with little children waiting for you all day at home
without caring to know if they want anything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Open quickly, she-devil! or I'll break your head open.</p>

<h3>SCENE XII.&mdash;&mdash;GORGIBUS, VILLEBREQUIN, ANG&Eacute;LIQUE, LE BARBOUILL&Eacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
Why, what is it now? still quarrelling and fighting?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>.
What? will you never agree?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ang</span>.
Only just look at him! he is drunk, and returns at this time of
night to make a noise and threaten to kill me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
She is right: it is not at this hour of night you should come
home. Why can you not, like a good father of a family, come home early
and live at peace with your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
Deuce take me, if I left the house! Ask those gentlemen who are
on the terrace there. It is she who has only just come home. Ah! how
innocence is always oppressed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
Well! Come, come, try to agree together, and ask her to forgive
you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bar</span>.
I ask her to forgive me! I had rather the devil flew off with
her. I am in such a terrible rage, I hardly know what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>.
Come, daughter, kiss your husband, and be friends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XIII.&mdash;&mdash;THE DOCTOR (<i>in night-gear at another window</i>).</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
What! always noise, disorder, dissension, quarrels, strife,
disputes, uproar, everlasting altercations? What is it? What can it
be? One can have no rest.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>. It is nothing, Mr. Doctor, every one is agreed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Ah! about being agreed, shall I read you a chapter of Aristotle,
where he proves that all the different parts of the universe subsist
only through the concord which exists between them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>. Will it be long?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
No, it's not a bit long, only about sixty or eighty pages.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>. Thanks, good night, good night!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. It is not necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>. Do you wish for it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Gor</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doc</span>.
Good night, then, since it is so&mdash;<i>latine, bona nox</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Vill</span>. Let us all go and have some supper together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb1" id="flb1"></a>[1]
An Italian game (Latin, <i>micare digitis</i>), in which one player
suddenly raises the hand of which some fingers are shut, and some are
open. The other players have to guess the number of fingers raised.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb2" id="flb2"></a>[2]
In most editions we find "<i>et que tout le monde o&ugrave; serait cette
monarchie florissante</i>," which has no meaning. The correct reading is
"<i>et que tu me donnerais le monde o&ugrave; serait</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb3" id="flb3"></a>[3] See 'Impromptu de Versailles,' Sc. i.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb4" id="flb4"></a>[4]
<i>Je suis bien tent&eacute; de te b&acirc;iller une quinte major.</i> Quinte major is
a term of piquet. It is here employed figuratively. Compare its use
in 'Les F&acirc;cheux,' Act ii. Sc. ii.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb5" id="flb5"></a>[5]
This seems to be the meaning of <i>"Je d&eacute;donne au diable l'escarcelle,
si vous l'aviez fait." Je d&eacute;donne au diable</i> is apparently a euphemism
for <i>Je donne au diable.</i> In French, compare <i>parbleu, corbleu</i>, &amp;c., and
<i>deuce, zounds, egad</i>, &amp;c., in English. <i>D&eacute;donne</i> is not given by Littr&eacute;.
It occurs again in 'Le M&eacute;decin Volant,' Sc. x., but does not seem to
have been employed elsewhere by Moli&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="flb6" id="flb6"></a>[6] Compare Sc. iv. 'Le Mariage Forc&eacute;.'</p>

<p class="noindent">It seems necessary to ascribe the saying to C&aelig;sar, rather than to
Cicero, in order to render to some extent this fearful pun.</p>

An enchanted dwarf in the old romance of 'Valentine and Orson,'
who manufactured a wooden horse, which could go very fast "<i>Courir
